<h3>ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>

<p>The next annual meeting of the American Missionary Association
will be held in Northampton, Mass., in the Edwards Church, commencing
at three o'clock Tuesday afternoon, October 21st. Rev. Frank W. Gunsaulus,
D.D., of Chicago, Ill., will preach the sermon. On the last page of
the cover will be found directions as to membership and other items of
interest. Fuller details regarding the reception of delegates and their entertainment,
together with rates at hotels and railroad reductions, will be
given in the religious press. A meeting of unusual interest is expected, and
we hope our friends will be present in full attendance.</p>

<p>For notice of Woman's Meeting, see page 318.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">-*-</p>

<p>The holding of our Annual Meeting in Northampton will call up some
very remarkable associations. Northampton was the home of Jonathan
Edwards, who was not only the eloquent preacher and profound theologian,
but the missionary to the neighboring Stockbridge Indians. It was also the
home of his son-in-law, David Brainerd, who was the typical self-denying
martyr-missionary to the Indians in New Jersey. It was the home of the
Tappan family, two of whose sons, Arthur and Lewis, were among the early
founders and most valued friends of this Association. In June, 1848, the
Tappan family held a joyous family reunion in Northampton, continuing
for a week.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">-*-</p>

<p>Frederick Douglass is hopeful. In a recent address he says: "A
great change has taken place among the colored race&mdash;vast and wonderful
has it been. It seems as if we had realized the vision of St. John when he

saw a new heaven and a new earth. But the change has come at last.
The time has come when we can look our fellow-citizens in the face and
share in the glory of the country."</p>

<p>No man has a better right to say this than he, for his life has touched
the degraded condition of the slave and the exalted position of an Embassador
of this great Republic. He adds: "Some talk of exterminating our
race, and others say we will soon die out, but I tell you both are impossible.
If slavery could not kill us, liberty won't." Liberty ought to do more
than save them alive. It ought to educate, elevate and Christianize them.</p>


<p style="text-align: center">-*-</p>

<p>The <em>Independent</em> quotes from Dr. Mayo's address before the American
Social Science Association on "The Third Estate," in which the Doctor,
refers to the strange population of the great Southern mountain world&mdash;nearly
two millions at present&mdash;as a body of people that sends forth a louder
cry for the missionary of modern civilization than any other portion of
the Republic, and adds:</p>

<div class="display">
<p>"What is also said by the Unitarian, Dr. Mayo, of the need of missionary work for
this class of the Southern whites, calls for an emphasis even stronger than we could put
on any political conclusion. We pass this patriotic appeal along to those who have the
wealth that is seeking a worthy object on which to expend itself. There are missionary
societies whose business it is to do this. For the Congregationalista, the American Missionary
Association will for a very moderate amount establish a church and an academy
in any one of a hundred counties inhabited by these people, and what a man with a
million dollars to expend could do we hardly dare to say. For the Presbyterians, the
Board of Home Missions will do the same; for the Methodists, their Missionary Society;
for the Episcopalians, their board of Domestic Missions; for the Baptists, their Home
Mission Society; and so on for all the religious bodies. But will not a goodly company
of wealthy men supplement what the churches are doing in their collections, by large
gifts for this special, most needy, most fruitful, and we declare most neglected mission
work of the nation?"</p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: center">-*-</p>

<p>Agitations on the surface are significant mainly as they are connected
with the larger movements of the deeper waters beneath. The re-election
of Speaker Reed to Congress, and the contest for the re-election of Mr.
Breckinridge in Arkansas; the Federal Election Bill, which proposes to
secure a free ballot for all men irrespective of color, and the Convention in
Mississippi, which aimed avowedly to curtail the voting of the colored people&mdash;all
these derive their importance from their relation to the gravest
problem of American statesmanship. That problem will not be settled by
the results of either of these current questions. For at the bottom the real
question is: Shall knowledge and character and property become the possession
of the colored race, and they thus be prepared for their place in
American politics, industry and prosperity, or will they be allowed for the
lack of these things to be crushed back into a condition of semi-slavery or

be goaded to resistance or discouraged in poverty, pauperism and degradation?
That is a fundamental question. For that, men should read, think,
pray and work.</p>
</div>

<div class="div">
<a name="toc_4"></a>
<h3>The Federal Election Bill And The Mississippi
Convention.</h3>

<p>The ultimate aim of the Federal Election Bill in Congress, and of the
Constitutional Convention in Mississippi, point in diametrically opposite
directions. They cannot be harmonized, and there is no middle way between
them. The Election Bill contemplates a "free ballot and fair
count" for every voter, including the Negro. The Mississippi Convention
aims to restrict Negro suffrage. In an address delivered by the President
of the Convention, September 11th, he is reported to have said that: "He
did not propose to mince matters and hide behind a subterfuge, but if asked
by anybody if it was the purpose of the Convention to restrict Negro suffrage,
he would frankly say, 'Yes; that is what we are here for.'" This
Convention proposes to secure its object not by the force and fraud of
earlier days, but by constitutional and legal methods&mdash;or at least by what
has constitutional and legal <em>forms</em>. All this, however, is another attempt to
achieve the impracticable. As the Negro grows in intelligence and numbers,
he will claim his right to vote.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Congressional Election Bill or any other legislation
intended to secure the privilege of voting to the Negro, if made
practical, means a good deal. If it is intended only to pass laws that
shall be merely "glittering generalities" to vindicate the historic record
of the Republican party, or to sanction its Platform and the Inaugural of
the President&mdash;that is easily done and will, of course, amount to nothing&mdash;except
as a political manoeuvre. But if the movement "means business,"
and is to be pushed to its legitimate result, then two things must be done:
the Negro must be qualified to vote and to be voted for; to elect officers
and to hold office. If the mass of illiterate and impoverished Negroes are
to be represented in State Legislatures and in Congress by persons as
ignorant and poor as they are themselves, these representatives will, of
course, if in the majority, be liable to rule and ruin; if in a large minority,
they will hold a balance of power that may easily be controlled by demagogues.
To educate this mass up to the point of intelligence and the acquisition
of property is America's great duty and the guaranty of her
safety.</p>

<p>There is one thing more about it. We have said that if the Negro is to
have the free exercise of the ballot, he will insist on being voted for as well
as voting. If the Negroes have power to elect, they will wish to elect some
of their own number. They will not, and certainly they ought not to vote
for a man simply because he is black. They should vote for the best

qualified man whether he is black or white. If they have the power they
will certainly elect some of their own number. But this means, if it means
anything good, that there shall be those of their own number who are
qualified to hold office and to hold it honorably to themselves and usefully
to their constituents and the country. But this implies higher education
to a good many colored people. It will not do for them to have a few men
educated as professional politicians. May Heaven save them from the day
when they will encourage the growth of such a class of men. They will
need to have a large number of educated men in the various walks of life, from
whom suitable candidates may be selected, just as white men have. But if
they are to have such a class of men, adequate measures must be taken for
their higher education, and those friends of the Negro who desire and help
to educate him only in primary studies, while they are doing a great and
essential work, are not doing all that is needed. It may be all well enough
to say to the Negro, "Work hard and keep out of politics." But if he is
allowed to enter into politics freely, he will do it just as other men do.
There is enough human nature in him to secure that. And any view of
this matter that accepts the theory of a free ballot to the Negro, will be
short-sighted, if it does not aim at the education of the mass of the Negroes
as the mass of the white people are educated, and at the higher education
of a proportionally large number of the Negroes. If Congress and Mississippi
Conventions should turn their attention in this direction, their work
would be more significant than the efforts they are now making.</p>

<h3>Notes From The West.</h3>

<h3 class="sub">By District-Secretary C.W. Hiatt.</h3>

<p>Sylvan, terraced, lacustrine; cottages by the score, gay in color, unique
of design; people everywhere, chatty, erudite, artistic, processional;
"round tables," "leagues," "societies" and "circles;" lectures, sermons,
concerts and conferences&mdash;a school, a church, a university&mdash;all this, and
throughout it all a steady pulse of religious heart and heartiness&mdash;such is
the Chautauquan Assembly of Bay View, Michigan. One of the important
features of this assembly is its annual missionary conference. All
denominations participate and the field of the world is brought vividly
before the mind by the laborers from here and there.</p>

<p>An interesting testimony by a missionary from Singapore was to the effect
that many of the most cultured and generous people he had ever met were
Chinese. By the aid of influential Mongolians&mdash;though they were heathen&mdash;he
was once enabled to start a school which grew rapidly till hundreds
were enrolled and a permanent religious center of great importance was established.
The whole account was thrilling.</p>

<p>Specially kind was the hearing given the representative of the American
Missionary Association work, and the eager quest for literature which followed

showed that all words had not been lost. Denominational lines were
not conspicuous. The black cat of statistics scampered across the rostrum
only once or twice. A fitting rebuke to this audacious creature was
couched in the story told by a missionary of a visit he had received from
another worker on the field, and their mutually forgetting to inquire into
each other's church connections, so great was their interest in the tasks in
hand. Afterwards, the Methodist brother learned that he had entertained
a Baptist unawares&mdash;Selah.</p>

<br>

<p>An interesting disclosure was recently made, when the organ of Vine St.
Congregational Church in Cincinnati was removed from the rear to the
front of the auditorium. Midway between ceiling and floor, on either side
of the recess, were two doors in the wall. These could only be reached by
ladders. What were they for? Ah, they have a history. They open into
rooms which, in ante-bellum days, were used as stations of the "underground
railway." Here fugitives from across the Ohio were secreted until
they could be spirited on, by night, towards the waters of Erie. These
doors on the wall speak volumes for the history of the church. I wonder
not that even now, though in the very commercial center of the city, far
from the residence portion, this church is in full career of evangelistic life.
Churches with such doors as those in their walls need not be expected to
vegetate, nor to die.</p>

<br>

<p>I like to visit the smaller churches as opportunity is given. Their zeal
for the causes of humanity is often very intense and intelligent. Sometimes,
too, their contributions are a surprise. I know a little country
church in Ohio that one day raised forty-six dollars when only forty-five
persons were present. It was ten miles by stage from the railroad. Now
another gratifying surprise: out of that little flock several people are planning
to go to the Northampton meeting.</p>

<p>I also know a church of foreigners, ninety-seven in membership, that
raised forty-seven dollars and fifty cents for our work in an evening collection,
or about fifty cents <em>per capita</em>. Awhile ago these foreigners were a
part of our <em>City</em> problem. By the grace of God, they are now out of the
equation, and themselves, in turn, become helpers in solving that other
more extensive problem, of the races in the South. Such things as these
encourage us.</p>

<h3>Out To Rockhold, Ky.</h3>

<h3 class="sub">Prof. R.C. Hitchcock</h3>

<p>I wanted to see the people and especially the church and Sunday-school
at this outpost. Now one can go out there by rail, but that is prosaic.
It is not apostolic; those apostles tied on their sandals, girt up their garments
and walked. But I found I couldn't do that way, for there was the
big Cumberland to cross and several creeks, not to speak of "runs,"
"branches" and mud-holes. The circuit riders? Yes, they went on horseback;
that must be my way, so I consulted Brother Tupper and he borrowed
Mr. Perkins's horse, noted as being an easy-going roadster. Easy?
Well, I do suppose the horse was all right, but I must indulge in one groan.
It was a long time since I had been on horseback. I wanted to go to the
stable to get on, but the young man insisted on bringing the steed down to
the hotel as soon as he had his feed, and in due time he came, a tall fellow,
and I doubted my ability to get my foot up to that stirrup, and somewhat
whether I could boost myself over into the saddle if I did; so I quietly
and gently coaxed him up to the piazza and actually succeeded the first
time trying. How many of the gentlemen, sitting in their Sunday best on
the piazza, smiled, I do not know&mdash;I didn't dare to look. I know I sat up
ever so stiff and tried to look just as if I had been a circuit rider for forty
years or so.</p>

<p>I must cross the river to begin with. Now they hadn't given me any
whip and I didn't dare ask the owner of the horse&mdash;"Colt, gone four"&mdash;he
said, for a whip or even a switch, but I wondered what I would do if the
animal should take it into his head to turn around or do something awkward
right in the middle of the river. I didn't want to get off, for I must
get on again. As good luck would have it there was a kind-eyed man sitting
on a stone by the riverside, and I asked him to get me a stick. He
gave me one he had in his hand and I felt better.</p>

<p>"Does the ford go right straight across?" I asked. "No, you must make
a curve up towards the dam or you will get into deep water, and there are
boulders too, you must avoid, or your horse may fall down."</p>

<p>A curve! Now a straight line, two points being given, can be defined.
And if I could steer for some given point on the opposite bank, I could hit
it if the current did not take me down stream; but a curve is awfully uncertain,
and my mind was in a state of perturbation. However, I got across
with nothing worse than a good spattering.</p>

<p>I wish I could paint the pictures constantly opening on the view as I
rode along. Forest clad mountains rose on every side with huge cliffs

peering grimly out. Sometimes these cliffs overhung the road and occasionally
a great slab of slate projected sufficiently to furnish shelter for a
family. In one place a farmer had taken advantage of this and made his
stable under a rock. A great slab of shaly slate projected so that he had a
roof some fifty feet long and ten or fifteen wide. My mind went back
eighteen hundred years and more to another stable in a rock and the
wonderful scene enacted there. It was not easy to believe that the little
cabins, looking like miniature houses which might be built by boys for
play, were actually homes, occupied by families, father, mother and eight
or ten children; but such is the case.</p>

<p>Seven miles of constantly changing pictures, but all beautiful, brought
me to Rockhold, a name I had supposed derived from its physical characteristics,
but which I was informed was given in respect to a family formerly
the most important in the vicinity but now quite gone. I made my
way to the little church. In front was a huge wagon and in a little grove
at the back several horses tied. I had been informed that I might safely
address any man I found prominent, as "Elliott," and as I entered I so accosted
an elderly man whom I found in charge of a large class of young
men. About fifty were present, Mr. Elliott being the only male teacher,
three young ladies, two of whom I learned had been educated at Berea, having
charge of classes. After the lesson I addressed the people. The characteristic
that impresses me more than any other is their solemn seriousness.
They listen intently and with great eagerness. They are hungry for preaching
and feel it a great hardship that they can only have it occasionally.
Their faces were a study. There was hardly a weak one among them and
many bore the impress of great strength. But I would as soon have told a
story or joked at a funeral as under their serious eyes.</p>

<p>The meeting over, several invited me to "go by" and take dinner, and
I accepted the first offer, which was made by a nice looking young lady in
mourning, who urged her claim by saying: "All the preachers go to our
house and father will be so disappointed if he don't see you; he couldn't
come to-day."</p>

<p>This country has not yet got to the point of thinking bridges necessary
and roads are not for those who sit on springs and cushions. I never
wished so much for a "Kodak" that I might carry away a picture which I
shall always have in memory. To the long wagon, which had a high rack
all around it, were yoked a pair of milk-white oxen, round and handsome.
In front was seated Mrs. Elliott, holding her youngest child. At her side a
boy, perhaps twelve, who guided the team by a line attached to a horn.
Seated on chairs were nine young ladies and girls, nearly all in pretty white
dresses.</p>

<p>Two miles of beautiful scenery and we reach the farm house, a commodious
and substantial rural home, of John Elliott, who gave me a cordial
welcome and soon the long table in the kitchen was spread with such a meal
as I had not enjoyed in many a day. The menu did not record many
French dishes, but everything was good, abundant and wholesome.</p>

<p>After dinner, Mr. Elliott told me a story worth recording. It was that
of the heroic Mr. Richardson, who before the war was a teacher in that district&mdash;a
Northern man&mdash;and, in the excited state of feeling in the South,
was suspected of being an abolitionist. He and his wife were driven from
their home and work, but protected from personal violence by the prompt
and energetic efforts of the Elliotts. But as both Dr. Roy and Mr. Ryder
have given the details to the public, I will not repeat them here. I will
only add that of the fifty persons who had signed the paper pledging themselves
to "<em>remove</em>" Richardson, it would be difficult to find one now in
Whittley County. They are scattered or dead. But in the little church at
Rockhold, the name of Richardson is a sacred one, and the stranger always
hears the story.</p>

<p>I took leave of this interesting family with great regret. As I sat in the
little grove in front of the house, with its carpet of myrtle, and looked off
over the peaceful valley, I wished I might remain there and rest.</p>

<p>That horse had it pretty much his own way on the return seven miles,
and when I thought nobody was looking I must confess to finding it a very
pleasant thing to get both legs on the same side of the saddle. But I am
glad I went to Rockhold. I would not lose the pictures I got there for a
small sum and I hope and pray that the time may soon come when in some
way a regular preacher may be provided for the people.</p>

<h3>Church Work.</h3>

<div class="div">
<h4>Dedication Of A Church At Byron, Ga.</h4>


<p>Words fail to express the pleasant time we had at Byron, in dedicating
our new house of worship to the service of God. We had a very large attendance
of people from Bibb, Houston, Taylor and Sumter counties.
Nearly two hundred people came from Andersonville, a large number came
from Macon and quite a company from Rutland. One brother was present
from the Savannah church. Altogether there were five of our Congregational
churches represented by their members and several others were heard
from. I should think that there were nearly, if not quite, four hundred
people on the grounds. Of course the building could not hold them all.
Rev. J.R. McLean preached the sermon, which was pronounced by a leading
white man present, to be the best he ever heard. Altogether the occasion
was an inspiring one. The hundreds of black faces so attentively listening
to the words of truth, so orderly and quietly, could not fail to impress
us deeply. The occasion was one that brought four of our churches
into a very close relationship, closer than they have ever been before; I

mean, so many from each church meeting face to face and forming each
other's acquaintance.</p>

<p>It is our wish and prayer to do well the work that is committed to our
hands. We are not afraid of hard work, we want time and means to do all
that we see is needed, and there is so much to be done. I feel like going,
going all the time with the message of God's love to dying men. The opportunities
are constantly increasing for usefulness.</p>
</div>

<div class="div">
<h4>Promising Opening In Georgia.</h4>

<p>I came to the place where the people wanted a Sunday-school. They
were ready for it, with a rude building erected by the people themselves,
and waiting for me to begin work, and I have promised to organize a Sunday-school
on the second Sunday of next month. A young married
woman, the wife of a well-to-do farmer, and a former student in the Ballard
School, has promised to superintend it. She expects at least fifty
scholars, many of them her day pupils. I have given her singing books and
shall send to Boston for Sunday-school supplies. There is reason to believe
that we can some day organize a church in that place. I preached
in the new building last night and at the close of the service nearly twenty-five
bowed for prayers and asked for mercy. It was really affecting and I
only regretted that I could not remain and continue the work which begins
in so promising a manner. I have not the time to describe in detail the
work done on this trip. All along the road for nearly forty miles people
stopped me and I them to talk about the love of God for man and the gift
of his dear son as their Saviour and Redeemer. My heart burns with a desire
to do them good and I am so happy in helping them see the truth as
it is revealed in the Bible. There are hundreds of colored people in that
county who have no proper religious instruction. They come from far and
near whenever I go into that region, and seem to be blessed in listening to
the word of God. I am constantly, from a half-dozen different counties,
hearing the Macedonian cry: "Come over and help us." I wish you could
go with me and see these golden opportunities. If our churches saw the
needs and the openings for doing good, they would increase many fold their
offerings to this work.</p>
</div>

<div class="div">
<h4>Encouraging Indications.</h4>

<p>I can see a manifestation of real earnestness on the part of a larger proportion
of the members of our church than at any time before since I
have been here. While none of our meetings are attended so well as they
should be, at the same time they are spiritual. And now, as we are getting
our minds and hearts ready for some extra meetings, our prayer meetings
are full of tenderness and sweetness. Last Thursday night, though it was
raining at the meeting hour, a goodly number came out and the blessed

Lord was with us. Our subject was "The Christian dignity of labor." It
seemed to be a new truth when they could see from his own word that
Jesus was interested in our daily work, John 21: 3-6. One faithful sister
who is trying to educate and provide for six children was very much helped
by the fact that Jesus would guide her if she was only willing to follow
his direction. The prayer meeting is the life of the church.</p>

<p>I spent two days with Brother S&mdash;&mdash; at B&mdash;&mdash; last month, in some extra
meetings. The meetings were quite well attended; a goodly number of
white people were with us at almost every meeting. The Methodist minister
of the town was present and offered prayer. He expressed himself
as highly pleased with the sermon and hoped that we might do much good
in the name of the Lord. I find the very best of feeling towards our
church there on the part of the white people. I hope the church will do
well and grow in numbers and influence.</p>

<br>

<p>JACKSON ST. CHURCH, NASHVILLE, TENN.&mdash;Yesterday was a red-letter
day for Jackson Street Church. It was communion day. Two were baptized
and admitted to the church. Our congregation numbered more than
one hundred, the largest audience we have yet had. It was also the day
for special collection. We collected thirteen dollars. This was done by
means of the envelope system without any blast of bugle. There were
eleven conversions in the Sunday-school recently.</p>

<br>

<p>HOWARD CHAPEL, NASHVILLE, TENN.&mdash;Our attendance this month has
never fallen below forty-five. One of the established churches of the city
with a membership five times as large as ours has an average of ten to its
prayer meetings. We have fifteen or twenty. We have also organized a
Y.P.S.C.E. and a Bible class. It is the purpose of this class to study
Biblical biographies. We have studied so far the lives of Joseph, Moses,
Daniel, Esther, Ruth and David. It would do your heart good to see with
what enthusiasm the young people have entered upon this study and how
they master even the minutest details. I have every hope in the world for
Howard Chapel.</p>

<br>

<p>SAVANNAH, GA.&mdash;Some years ago our flock was the smallest, now we
have the largest Sunday-school and congregation. The history of this
church is wonderful. God has been merciful towards it. Some who were
our strongest enemies years ago are now our best workers. I have a plan
for next winter, to open a night school and draw the young people from
sin and Satan to our blessed Lord. July the 18th, Brother L. and myself
went to Porter's and made a start on our meeting house. The man who
gave the land cut down trees, Brother L. dug holes and we planted the
posts. Brother L. went back and bought five hundred feet of lumber, and
with God's help we intend to take the train some day and finish our humble
place of worship.</p>

<br>


<p>NORTH ATHENS, TENN.&mdash;The church members gather with the children
every Friday afternoon to teach both boys and girls various kinds of work.
Capitalists and speculators are searching among the mountains for coal, iron
and timber. Why should not the Christian church search out the poor
mountaineers and bring them to Christ. Most of them were loyal to the
country. Slavery has for several generations denied them the advantages
of education. God has opened the door and bids us go in with the Bible
and the spelling-book to give to two millions of these people in our own country
a better culture, a purer Gospel. There are vast stores of wealth in these
mountains, but nothing of such value as the souls of this people.</p>

<h3>Straight University.</h3>


<div class="display">
<p>We are glad to copy from the Burlington (Vt.) <em>Daily Free Press</em> the following
commendation of two of the appointees of this Association, both graduates of the University
of Vermont. Mr. Atwood enters our service for the first time; Mr. Henderson
has already shown his efficiency in our work as a preacher, and will enter upon his
duties as a Professor under favorable auspices.</p>

</div>

<p>An eminently satisfactory and well-merited appointment is that of Mr.
Oscar Atwood of Jeffersonville, to be President of Straight University in
New Orleans. We can heartily congratulate the institution that it can
avail itself of the sound scholarship, the long experience, and the tried executive
ability of its president-elect. And no less do we congratulate Mr.
Atwood on his election to a post which will afford ample scope and stimulus
for the best that is in him. Straight University was founded twenty-one
years ago, and was designed especially for the education of the colored
youth. It is under the patronage of the American Missionary Association,
and has several departments in full operation. Mr. Atwood took his A.B.
degree at the University of Vermont in 1864; taught for a time in various
schools, including the academy at Essex, this State; for two years was
principal of the school at Underhill; then for seven years, 1871-78, was
master of the High School at Plattsburgh, from which place he was called
to a similar position at Rutland. After nine years successful labor there, he
was forced to resign three years since on account of continued trouble with
his eyes. He has an excellent record both as instructor and organizer and
manager of school work. No better evidence of his efficiency could be
desired than the large number of young men who have been stimulated by
him to obtain a liberal education.</p>

<p>We learn also that the Rev. George W. Henderson, of the class of 1887,
U.V., who for the last two years has been preaching in New Orleans,
has been appointed to a professorship in the same institution. Mr. Henderson
was originally a slave, as some of our readers know. He was prepared
for college by Mr. Atwood, took high rank at the University and at

Yale Theological Seminary, where he was graduated in 1883. He studied
for a time in Germany, and for a few years was principal of an academy in
this State. His work, we understand, is to be in the theological department,
a position for which he is well equipped.</p>

<h3>Better Class Of Students.</h3>

<h3 class="sub">By Prof. R.C. Hitchcock.</h3>

<p>Last year was a "golden year" at Straight University in New Orleans.
In the first place, it is seldom the good fortune of any school to get a corps
of teachers so uniformly capable, and of such earnest Christian spirit, willing
to spend and be spent in the Master's service.</p>

<p>Then every year brings a better class of students; not more sincere,
perhaps, but year by year they learn what "getting an education" means.
A few years ago it was quite impossible to make them realize that steady,
uninterrupted attendance was absolutely necessary to good work, but as
they have opportunity to compare the positions taken and the work done
by those who were regular and who remained at school long enough to be
really fit for good service, with those who thought they could come in January
and leave in April, getting an imperfect knowledge of things, to their
credit be it told, they <em>learn</em>&mdash;some <em>cannot</em> learn life's lessons&mdash;and there
has been lately a gratifying eagerness to be present at every recitation during
the whole year. I do not think one has left this year who could possibly
remain. When the floods came and many of them learned that their
homes were under water, in some cases the savings of many years in
buildings and stock washed away, they came to us saying they must go
as they could no longer pay, but we told them to wait. White-winged
missives flew over Uncle Sam's postal way, and back from many a church
and Sunday-school came the needed aid, and&mdash;save in the case of
some young men who had to care for helpless ones at home&mdash;none
left. From these last came many an interesting story of the heroic efforts
to save life and property. The skill to wield tools, acquired in our
shop, helped many a one to build a "flat" in which family, stock and furniture
could be floated to dry land. Many had to work night and day up
to the waist, sometimes to the neck, in water to save what might be. It
will be a hard year, the coming one, for many in the parishes of this State,
though no doubt work will be plenty as soon as the water is down.</p>

<h3>Temperance In Tennessee.</h3>

<p>This is certainly a very interesting field, not going backward but forward.
The temperance reform has made a clean sweep of the whole
village, and in union with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union at
the station is fast pushing the saloons to the wall. The most striking

feature of the case is that they have learned how to work in the absence of
their leader. Two weeks ago last Sabbath night they held their own meeting&mdash;a
Bible reading institution among themselves, by the way, at which
many were present&mdash;and the old revival spirit broke out afresh to such a
degree that the last of their friends, to the number of eighteen, who still
clung to their cups, made haste to sign the pledge of total abstinence.</p>

<h3 class="sub">Letter From A Graduate Of Straight University.</h3>

<p>There was an examination held in this city recently for clerkships at
Washington. The announcement of it in the newspapers and the certainty
of the successful applicants receiving appointments drew a large number
of young men to the examination, among whom were Tulane University
graduates and several principals of high schools. I had the honor of sustaining
the reputation of "Old Straight," by leading the list. The affair
created much local excitement and the name of Straight University is commanding
much respect. I am pleased at the prospect of the increased opportunities
a residence at Washington will afford me for the prosecution
of my medical studies.</p>

<h4>Pictures In The Pines.</h4>

<h4 class="sub">Prof. Amos W. Farnham.</h4>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">In the Sunny South, in the Land of Pines,</p>
<p class="l">Is a whitewashed cottage, old and grand;</p>

<p class="l">Its ample grounds of jessamine vines,</p>
<p class="l">Are bright with crystals of sparkling sand.</p>
<p class="l">Broad stairways lead to its airy hall</p>
<p class="l">And cool piazzas, where the sun </p>
<p class="l">His shining arrows ne'er lets fall </p>
<p class="l">Till his daily race is almost run.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Within are walls of panels high,</p>

<p class="l"> And great fire-places that laugh at night, </p>
<p class="l">When the blazing splinters of lightwood fry</p>
<p class="l">And wrap the rooms in a flood of light. </p>
<p class="l">'Tis then the cabins in the rear, </p>
<p class="l">Low and little and plain and old, </p>
<p class="l">Are vocal with the Negro'a cheer, </p>
<p class="l">For his heart is light when the day is told.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">But there's one who sits from the rest apart,</p>
<p class="l">With folded hands and turbaned head,</p>
<p class="l">With a nameless burden upon her heart,</p>
<p class="l">And the light of youth forever fled.  </p>
<p class="l">And she sits a swaying to and fro,  </p>
<p class="l">Like the billowy pine with plume and cone,</p>
<p class="l">While a minor strain subdued and slow,  </p>

<h2>The Indians.</h2>

<h3>Mr. Shelton At Northfield Again.</h3>

<div class="display">
<p>Mr Moody is nothing if not practical, and when he undertakes a thing he is apt
to push it through. We give below another pleasant illustration of this. Our readers
will remember that Rev. C.W. Shelton two years ago made an address at the great
Missionary Meeting at Northfield, Mass., which touched the sympathies of the audience
and moved Mr. Moody at once to "do something about it." Under his inspiration
three thousand five hundred dollars were raised to establish several new Indian
mission stations in Dakota.</p>

<p>At Mr. Moody's solicitation, Mr. Shelton attended the Northfield Missionary Meeting
this year, making report of what had been done with the money given before.
The enthusiasm of the audience was again kindled, with a result which we give below,
condensing the sketch of the meeting as given in the <em>Springfield Union</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The meeting opened with prayer by Major D.W. Whittle, and then Rev
C.W. Shelton of New York City, who is connected with the American Missionary
Association, spoke about the work among the Indians. He said
that two years ago the people of Northfield gave money enough to establish
five mission stations; and he would first report on the work in those
missions. The first one had been established one hundred and fifty miles
northwest of Bismarck, and was called the Moody station. Having found
two classes of people thirty miles apart, both of whom seemed to be equally
in need, we had been in doubt as to where to plant the station; but finally
a man was found whose parentage included both nations, and who was
willing and able to preach to both in their own language. We had, therefore,
started two stations, calling them both by the same name, and with this
man managing them. People had told him that he couldn't do anything
in the interior of the country occupied by the Indians, but he described
his meeting with the Indians at that remote place, and their willingness to
receive the gospel, one of the chiefs finally saying to him: "When you go
back I want you to take that man by the hand that sent that school and
thank him, and tell him that we will try to live like the white man." The
speaker accordingly took Mr. Moody's hand and thanked him in those
words, raising a perfect storm of applause by so doing.</p>

<p>The next mission was called the Frederick Darling Memorial mission,
and was established sixty miles below Bismarck. There was good work going
on there. Sixty miles farther down still there was located the Robert
Remington Memorial mission, and the reservation had since then been
opened up for settlement, as they had prophesied, and, as the Indians came
up the valley, driven out from their homes, there stood a man at the door
of the mission, who invited them in, and so to-day there were gathering
round that mission hundreds of Indians, forsaking their tepees, building
their houses and taking the first steps toward civilization.</p>



<p>On Cherry Creek, the Sankey mission was located, and, although it was
not two years since that work was begun, they had a church of about forty
members.</p>

<p>The funds for the Northfield mission were given by quite a number of
people here and the Indians who could be reached by it from the opening
of the reservation during the last few months had nearly doubled.
They had organized one church only a few weeks ago some distance off,
and expected to organize another there within a few months.</p>

<p>"What do you want now?" said Mr. Moody at this point. Mr.
Shelton replied: "We haven't a dollar for carrying on a single one of
these missions after the first of September. It costs from $300 to $350 to
carry each of them on. But I believe that God has started this work and will
carry it on. Let me add a word with regard to the whole Indian problem. It is
not the problem I presented to you two years ago; it has changed in the two
years, and, thank God, it will change in two years more, if we do the work
we ought to. Do we realize that our Indians are getting beyond the wild
life? Forty thousand Indian people have come out of the tepee life into
little homes that these Indian men have built for themselves, taking their
people forward toward Christ. We talk of the Indian in his paint and
blanket, forgetting that he is coming forth into life. His game is gone, his
wild roving life is gone, his reservation is going. They understand their
position; the old life is back of them forever. What is before them?
Old Gall showed a scar reaching from his shoulder to his hip, and said:
'A white man gave me that; shall I trust him, dare I trust him, can I
trust him?' The Indian takes a step ahead, and stops and trembles,
doesn't know if he dare take another.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know the solution of the Indian problem to-day? In
Christ's love take the Indians by the hand and lead them out into the same
light, the same love, and to the same Christ that you have. You can talk
about the government and land in severalty. Grand and good as these are,
the first and all-important thing in that problem is the gospel of Christ. It
must do it, it can do it, it is doing it, it will do it. The Women's Missionary
Societies of fifteen Indian churches gave $200 more for home missionary
work outside themselves than the Women's Missionary Societies in
one hundred and forty churches of white people in the same time. They
have Christian Endeavor societies there, and all kinds of Christian work.
I saw one morning delegates from the Christian Endeavor Society going
out to teach a white Sunday-school nine miles off in one direction, and
another similar school four and one-half miles off in another.</p>

<p>"It is said that the young people will go back to the blanket. In ten
years we have had only one case of that in our Santee school, and that was
the case of a young girl who had only been in the school six months; 95
per cent. of all that come to the schools go back consecrated young men
and women.</p>



<p>"When you think that your five stations have gathered in two or three
hundred scholars and of the possibility for each, can you tell what will be
the result of this work? There are thirty thousand poor Indians in Dakota
alone, lifting up their cry to the Christian church for light and hope."
He added: "I have turned my back to many storms on the Dakota prairies,
but God grant you may never turn your back on a soul praying for
light. I sometimes dread the day of judgment, because there is to stand
the Indian. I would rather stand there in his place than to hear him say:
'I was hungry and ye gave me no food.' How shall we meet it, how shall
we answer it? for to meet it and answer it we must before the throne."</p>

<p>Here Mr Shelton finished and sat down. "Now let's pay our debts,"
said Mr. Moody. "How many people will give $100 toward that $1,800 for
sustaining those missions?"  It didn't seem as though there were many
responses at first, but in a few minutes eighteen names were handed to H.M.
Moore of Boston, who was keeping account, and then Mr. Moody asked
if there wasn't anything else he wanted&mdash;a new mission anywhere?  Mr.
Shelton of course said there was, and spoke of a place on the Rosebud
Agency where $500 was needed to build a school, and $300 to take care of
it for a year.  Here was Mr. Moody's chance again, and he asked if some
one wouldn't give $100 for that.  One or two contributions of $100 were
forthcoming, and any number of fifties came in, so that it was only a few
minutes when Mr. Moore announced that they had $875 for that.  Then
Mr. Moody said he wanted to have the people start one more new mission
and proposed that unfailing American resource, a collection.  The
hats were soon busy in all parts of the house, and at the end of the meeting
it was found that $640 had been collected for another mission, making
a grand total of $3,315.04, to be exact, raised within twenty minutes, for the
work among the Dakota Indians.  Mr. Moody looked more bright and
cheerful than he has during the conference, as he kept calling for more
contributions, and his method of applying for one seldom failed.  "Col.
Esty, of Brattleboro, isn't here, but he's all right, so we'll put him down
for $100," he remarked, as the interest flagged for a moment, and that was
the signal for a laugh and another name was sent up. Altogether it was the
most enthusiastic and thoroughly roused audience of the session.</p>

<h3>The Widow's Mite.</h3>

<div class="display">
<p>We gladly subjoin the following brief note from Mrs. Mary E. Fairbanks, of St.
Johnsbury, Vt., addressed to Rev. Mr. Shelton.  We appreciate, as she does, the gift
of the widow.</p>
</div>

<p>"Please find enclosed (stamps) .50 for the Indian work.  A few days
after you were with us, a poor widow, aged and feeble, brought some sewing
which she had done for me, and for which I paid her $2.50. She
handed back fifty cents, asking me if I could in any way send it to Mr.

Shelton for the work among the Indians. 'A widow's mite,' she said. I
told her I would be very glad to do it. I think the Lord must have looked
with favor on her gift. I have often sent to her missionary papers, magazines,
etc., and know she had greatly enjoyed the reading. You certainly
touched her heart, as you did many others. I hope the Lord is fulfilling
your desires."</p>

<h2>The Chinese</h2>

<div class="div">
<a name="toc_17"></a>
<h3>The Pictures</h3>

<p>Dr. Pond has sent us two pictures which we are glad to insert in this
number. Of one of them he says: "It is a photograph of our Oroville
Mission House, pupils, teachers, etc. The taller of the two white men in
light clothing is the young pastor of our church at Oroville, who is a real
<em>helper</em>; the other is myself. The two white ladies are Miss Deuel, former
teacher, on the right, and Miss Keifer, the present teacher, sitting next to
me. The little American boy is her nephew, greatly interested in the
school. The little Chinese boy is a child whom the brethren have partially
and after a sort adopted, and who is very bright and promising and means
to be a Christian. Our helper, Chung Moi, stands directly behind me; but
the picture does him injustice. He has a very prepossessing face. The
one who stands on the left of Miss Deuel (i.e. at <em>her</em> right hand) is Gee
Jet, the deacon of our little church and the stand-by of the mission. The
trees in the rear grow at the water's edge of Feather River. The building,
as you observe, is of brick, topped out with a shake roof put on by our
brethren after the last (of two or three I believe) sweeping fires to which
the little structure refused to succumb. It belongs to ex-Governor Perkins
of this State&mdash;once a merchant in Oroville&mdash;and has been used by us for
ten years or more, ever since our mission was established, free of rent."</p>

<p>The other cut is also a picture of the teachers and pupils at Oroville.</p>
</div>

<h3>Lights And Shadows</h3>

<h3 class="sub">Rev. W.C. Pond, D.D.</h3>

<p>LIGHTS.&mdash;One teacher writes: "Mr. B. [a distinguished lecturer from
Ohio] visited our school. He said that he had never seen before such
bright, happy faces among the Chinese. I told him the reason; they have
been brought out from heathenism. I love to notice the change it makes
in them."</p>

<p>Chin Toy writes from Riverside: "Five boys converted and joined in
Association since I came. Four boys are going to join Rev. Mr. Hunt's
church, (Congregational), and be baptized at the first Sunday of July.
This Association of Christian Chinese has ten members now. I like these
boys and like these teachers too; they are so helpful to the Lord's work."</p>

<p>Hong Sing writes from Petaluma: "Now I am going to ask you
especially to pray for two scholars here who I hope for to gain him to
Christ before I leave. I am glad that one accepted my advice and promised
yesterday to join our Association, but sorry the other one excuse. I
pray to God for the Holy Spirit to open his eyes to see his guilt and danger,
and how much he needs a Saviour."</p>

<p>From a pupil in Santa Barbara, addressed to our missionary helper,
Loo Quong: "It is now fifth month since I left you at Los Angeles. The
time seems very long indeed. We hope dear God give you a great power
to cast out the devil; and sowing the seed it bring forth fruit hundred fold
into the only God. At beginning we came to the United States [i.e. I
first came to the United States] about May, 1881. We did not know of
Jesus Christ, because born in the heathen country and work here in the
Chinese store. Then we hear the Chinese mission&mdash;talk with Jesus Christ,
do nothing to our idols and very different from us, for we were with evil
companions and do many things in gambling, lottery tickets, opium. Dr.
Pond open Congregational mission school about 1887 in Los Angeles, very
near our house. Then we was been to school about every evening. Mrs.
Sheldon and you teach very kind to us, and you explain the gospel of
Jesus. So we know the only true God, leave evil companions, join our Association
and sixth month join Dr. Hutchins' church. 'And when they had
brought their ships to land, they forsook all and followed him.'&mdash;Luke 5:11."</p>

<p>From Fresno; from Loo Quong: "Now I have some good news for
you. There were three more of our pupils joined the Association, making
nine in all. God will care for this little flock of his, and may they multiply
a hundred fold! One of them was in school at Hong Kong many
years ago before he touched the American soil. He also was in our Central
School at San Francisco three years ago. Two months ago I was surprised
to see him here. At once he attended our school and began to ask
me about Christ's teaching. He would have no other lesson but in the
Bible." (Miss Worley writes of this pupil that he wishes now to become a
missionary). Of another of these three, Loo Quong writes: "He is one
of the best young men I ever knew, * * so kind, so quiet, so modest,
so full of love. I think he looks like our Lord when on earth. He is
always on hand at school. When I asked him to join the Association, he
said that he fully believed Jesus that he is the Saviour of his soul, 'but how
can I be his disciple while I am in the gambling business?' We explained
to him how God would take care of those who gave up all for him, and the
next night he told me he was ready to give it up and walk with Christians."
Of the third, also, a good account is given, but I must not use more space
on the Lights, but turn to the</p>

<p>SHADOWS&mdash;One example must suffice. I must not mention either place
or person, lest harm come of it. A teacher writes: "I feel sure that two little
boys whom you sent to assist in our anniversary will grow to Christian manhood,

fed as they are on the Word. With sorrow I compared with their
surroundings those of our little &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, and I write to know if something
cannot be done. Two years ago he entered the school, having come
directly from China. He has always been studious and well-behaved, loving
his Bible and the gospel songs. The mission boys tell me that those
with whom he lives are not his parents, but that this man bought him in
China. The child remembers his mother and brothers. He also remembers
a man offering him something if he would go with him. He did so
and was carried off in a boat and sold. His owner is very fond of him,
but is away from home. The wife does not care much for him. Sometimes
there are black and blue marks on his hands where he says she
strikes him. Once there was a small burned place on both his lips. I
asked him about it, and he said "Mamma." One of the boys told me that
he talked too much and she put the hot poker on his lips. I have heard
that this man intends taking the boy back to China in a year or two, fearing
that in this county he will lose him. They are bad people, keeping
an opium den."</p>

<p>The shadow deepens when the question rises, "What can be done for
this boy?" He is in the grip of an "<em>Imperium in imperio</em>," to which some
years ago I had occasion to refer in these columns. Even Americans who
know the facts and are eager to help him, feel as though it would be
scarcely safe for them to rescue him. Our wisest Chinese helpers say:
"Wait, watch over him, but don't disturb existing relations. It would
break up our mission in that place. Chinese would not dare to be identified
with it. The boy will soon come to understand his rights and will assert
them for himself, and then you can help him." But it almost makes
one's blood boil to think that on American soil such counsel can be given
and perhaps ought to be observed.</p>

<p>We call especial attention of ladies to the Woman's Meetings at Northampton,
Mass., Oct. 21st and 23d. The first, on Tuesday, of which notice
is given above, is the meeting of the Women's Organizations of the several

<h3>Christian Endeavor For The Boys And Girls Of The
Southern Mountains</h3>

<h3 class="sub">A New Need.</h3>


<p>A large number of the mountain people are so poor that they cannot
pay even the bare cost of living for their girls and boys in order that they
may have the privilege of attending school. Rarely can a family send
more than one child to school, and in every case where one can go a boy
is selected. The brothers must wait until perhaps too late, and the sisters
must remain at home in ignorance. Thus it is found that the advantages
of Christian schools, brought so near to the mountain boys and girls by the
American Missionary Association, are not yet sufficiently within their reach,
and this gives rise to a new need in connection with our work in the South.
It is a need of young people and we turn to young people to meet it, believing
that our Christian Endeavor Societies and other Young People's
Societies will not lose this special opportunity for missionary work.</p>

<p>A Student's Fund of $3,000 is to be raised in $50 shares, upon which
we will draw to bring the young people of the mountains into these
schools, and to help them over hard places according to their need. Pupils
will be encouraged to help themselves all they can, and no pledges will be
made to any until they have reached the limit of their own resources, and
no specified amount will be assigned to any one pupil. Each will be
helped according to his condition. A boy may be able to reach the school

and work part of his board and need only a small sum to cover the expense
of the full year. A girl may need to have her traveling expenses paid and
only this; another, giving promise of usefulness, may have her full way
paid during the year. Some will be kept through the entire school year,
who otherwise could study but a few months.</p>

<p>The training the young people receive in these schools brings a sure
reward. We quote from a letter just received from one of our missionaries:
"I am very hopeful for the Christian work among the students this
year. The Christian Endeavor Society is in much better condition than
last year. The members understand better the meaning of 'Christian Endeavor,'
and that being a Christian means a daily application of Christian
principles to every day life."</p>

<p>Now why cannot our Christian Endeavor and Young People's Societies
take this work to their hearts, and thus be the means of preparing others for
Christian work? Why not do for these poor, but bright and interesting
American boys and girls there, what will bring more of them into the fraternity
of Christian Endeavor?</p>

<p>We will send at once to any who desire it, full information of our
mountain work, and all who contribute to this fund may have their offering
assigned to aid pupils in one of our schools, from which letters will be
written by a missionary during the year, giving information directly from
the field.</p>

<p>Here is an urgent need outside our usual lines of expense, for which
we seek new and additional help&mdash;not the diversion of regular annual contributions.
We break the fund into shares of $50 that many may have
part in it. Early response either in cash, or pledges to be cashed by July,
1891, will result in giving many of these young people the advantages of
Christian education during the present school year.</p>

<h3>Woman's Work In North Carolina</h3>

<p>We have a Woman's Missionary Meeting once a month; it began last
November, with six members; there are now eleven. We have, too, a Mission
Band, which many of the older scholars have joined as associate members.
It is held fortnightly, after the Sunday school, and generally the
whole congregation stay to hear what is going on.</p>

<p>Last Sunday morning we went to Pekin, starting at 8 A.M. It is a
drive of fifteen miles through turpentine forests, and the roads are very
rough; we go up hill and down all the way, three creeks to cross and one
river. Across this there is a bridge, rather originally constructed. We go
down a steep and sharp curve, on the edge of high banks, and then through
a covered bridge across the rushing stream, which is seen between the foot
planks, and we are thankful to get across without any backing on our

horse's part. The woods are very lovely just now, very few wild flowers,
but such a variety of foliage, and we notice a beautiful flowering shrub,
called "ivory "; it is a mass of delicate pink or white blossoms. These turpentine
forests are by no means all pines, there are many varieties of oak.</p>

<p>The Sunday-school at Greenlake church, Pekin, is held at 9 A. M. Our
object this morning is to meet the children and teachers, before they disperse,
and organize a Mission Band. The little church, or rather schoolhouse,
is situated on a hill, and there is a fine view of the rolling country;
only this morning one longs for a little shade. One of our former scholars
(now working in the turpentine) comes out and takes our horse.</p>

<p>The school is just over, and we hear there is to be preaching at 11; it
is now 10:15, so we ask the pupils to stay. We sing and then Miss Bechan explains
about foreign missions and mission bands. They give in their names
and appoint officers, agreeing to meet twice a month. They have also a
Woman's Missionary Auxiliary, which has been meeting once a month since
last December.</p>

<p>There is a recess of ten minutes, then the preaching begins. The
preacher is a young man, who would gain much (as would his hearers) by
attending school a few years. This is one of the heart-sores in the
work here&mdash;the great ignorance of many of the preachers. Some of them
will tell you, they have had "no education," and, indeed, it is all too plain,
from their curious expressions and mis-applied long words; but worst of
all is their ignorance of the Bible. But how can they do better till they
have been taught? There is a crying need of educated pastors in these
country places. The young men tell us, they "do not find religion interesting;"
one said,that, after "having tried it two or three times." It is
hardly to be wondered at, that they are not interested, when the thunder is
all that is shown them. They are told they ought "to quake and tremble,"
and if they do not, they "show by their actions that they mean to go to
hell."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
